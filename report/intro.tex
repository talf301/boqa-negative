[TODO: introduce disease diagnosis in general, reference QR network or something like that]
Computer assisted diagnosis is a useful and desirable tool that has been challenging the AI community for many years. Jaakkola et Al. \cite{qmrdt} introduced the QMR-DT network, a major example  of a probabilistic graphical model built on expert knowledge used for CAD. 
CAD is particularly useful in the realm of rare genetic diseases, where clinical geneticists will often be tasked with diagnosing patients with disorders they may only see a couple of times in their careers. In this regard, having a tool which can make some reasonable suggestions for diagnoses a clinician may have never seen before is invaluable. \\
In order for a CAD system to be feasible, one requires either a very large training set of diagnosed patients, or some expert information relating disorders and symptoms. Clearly, the first option is not a possibility in our domain, but the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) \cite{kohler2014hpo} and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) \cite{omim} together introduce respectively a powerful, standardized dictionary for describing human conditions as well as disorders and their associated symptoms.
