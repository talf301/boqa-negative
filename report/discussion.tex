\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:dis}

In the present study, we have no information on correlations between diseases.
%
In particular, our ranking evaluation metrics do not take into account the
relative severity of ranking particular diseases above the gold-standard disease.
%
However, in reality it may be the case that the model ranks a close variant
above the gold-standard disease, in which case the misclassification cost
incurred should be lesser than if an unrelated disease were higher ranked.
%
A further investigation is necessary to determine whether the relative
performance of the considered methods would change under such a cost metric.
