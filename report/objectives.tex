What are we trying to solve and how are we gonna do it?


Let $(Q_1, ..., Q_M)$ be query variables.
Let $I_1$ be a disease that is explicitly negatively annotated to $Q_1$.
Let $I_2$ be a disease that is not explicitly annotated to $Q_1$.
Let $I_3$ be a disease that is explicitly annotated to $Q_1$.

\begin{align*}
    P(Q_1 = 0, \hdots, Q_M \mid I_1) \\
    P(Q_1 = 1, \hdots, Q_M \mid I_3) \\
    P(Q_1 = 0, \hdots, Q_M \mid I_2) \\
    P(Q_1 = 1, \hdots, Q_M \mid I_2) \\
    P(Q_1 = 0, \hdots, Q_M \mid I_3) \\
    P(Q_1 = 1, \hdots, Q_M \mid I_1) 
\end{align*}
